Corrales Animal Services: The visualization shows 3 adopted 1 available but 2 are really available: Primrose and Prescott. This might be because Primrose was adopted once and returned. The query might not be looking for 'adopted' in the most recent document and just accepting 'adopted' at any point in time. 

Tucumcari Animal Shelter: The visualization shows 8 adopted and 1 available but 2 are really available: Littles and Buttercup. It's the same situation as above. Littles was adopted and then returned. 

Espanola Humane Society: The visualization shows 15 adopted and 2 available. There's actually 15 adopted, one euthanized and one available. So the query is counting Bitsy as available probably because her status isn't 'adopted'.

Gallup McKinley County Humane Society: The visualization shows 18 adopted and 1 available. This might be because Junebug was returned and re-adopted and the re-adoption isn't getting picked up.

Humane Society of Lincoln County: The visualization shows 33 adopted and 4 available but there is really 32 adopted and 5 available. Those who are available are Tom Hardy, Polly Pocket, Jango, Latte, and Captain Kidd. Of these Latte was adopted on Dec 2 and returned on the 4gth.
