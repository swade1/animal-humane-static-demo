# Perplexity Advice and Guidance

## Creating a Front End 
Let me know if you want:
* Sample FastAPI and React starter templates,
* Design mockups or dashboard examples,
* Guidance on making it AI-ready (e.g., conversational agent integration),
* Advice on deployment and authentication.


Start the API server (from animal-humane directory)
`uvicorn main:app --reload`. 
view in browser: `localhost:8000`

To scrape and push data only (Outside of the FastAPI server), run: 
`python main.py`


Start the npm server (from the react-app directory)
`npm start`
Automatically opens browser at port 3000.
