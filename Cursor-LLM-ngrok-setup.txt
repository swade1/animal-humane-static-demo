Step 1: Run Ollama and Start Local Model Server

Start the Ollama local API server with:
```
ollama serve
```

This starts the server at http://localhost:11434.

Step 2: Configure ngrok to Expose Local Server
ngrok dashboard: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/macos
ngrok sign in info: ..09@gmail.com, m1_ngrokm1_ngrok
Authorization token saved to ~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml

```
ngrok authtoken 2FfsjxKAjtXDmcCfvyCUPPLrm9d_86h6xdq26uHmg4U4WbnTv 
```

Expose the Ollama server publicly with:

```
ngrok http 11434
```

Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL that ngrok gives you (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io).

Step 3: Configure Cursor to Use the Local DeepSeek Model

Open Cursor IDE.

Go to Settings -> Cursor Settings -> Models

Make sure deepseek-coder-v2:16b-lite-base-q4_K_M is selected. (Add it if it's not already there)

For the OpenAI API Key, enter any placeholder text, e.g., ollama (it won't be validated).

Find the option to Override OpenAI Base URL or Custom API Endpoint.

Paste your ngrok URL with /v1 appended at the end, e.g.,
https://abc123.ngrok.io/v1

The settings auto-save; close the settings pane.

Restart Cursor for good measure to apply changes.

Step 4: Use Your Local DeepSeek in Cursor
Open Cursor’s chat panel (Cmd + L).

Select your newly added DeepSeek model in the model dropdown.

Start typing coding prompts or requests powered by your local DeepSeek model.

Extra Tips:
Keep the terminal running Ollama and ngrok open while working.

If the ngrok session ends, restart it and update the API Base URL in Cursor.

For improved privacy, consider using Cloudflare tunnel or similar instead of ngrok.

This workflow will give you a fast, private, and powerful AI coding assistant inside Cursor using your local DeepSeek LLM.
